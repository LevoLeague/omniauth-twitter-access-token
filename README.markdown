# OmniAuth Twitter Access Token

Twitter Access Token Strategy for OmniAuth 1.0.

Supports client-side flow only. And fully compatible with [omniauth-twitter](https://github.com/arunagw/omniauth-twitter).
(Auth Hash is the same & etc')

Mostly shamelessly copied from [omniauth-facebook-access-token](https://github.com/SoapSeller/omniauth-facebook-access-token)

## Installing

Add to your `Gemfile`:

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-twitter-access-token'
```

Then `bundle install`.

## Usage

### Server-Side
`OmniAuth::Strategies::TwitterAccessToken` is simply a Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth 1.0 docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth.

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :twitter_access_token, ENV['TWITTER_KEY'], ENV['TWITTER_SECRET']
end
```

### Client-Side

Login via ajax GET/POST call to `/auth/twitter_access_token/callback` while providing `token` & `token_secret` parameter.
